In this hierarchy, the Expense class serves as the base class, 
and all the derived classes (Bill, Entertainment, Medical, Education,
Groceries, Emergency) inherit from it. Each derived class represents 
a specific type of expense, with its own unique attributes and behaviors.

This inheritance structure allowed us to define common methods and 
attributes in the Expense base class, which can be inherited and 
overridden by the derived classes as needed. It provides a way to 
organize and categorize different types of expenses while promoting code reuse and flexibility.

           +--------------+
           
 In this hierarchy, the PremiumUser class inherits from the 
 NormalUser class, which in turn inherits from the User class. This allows the 
 PremiumUser class to have access to all the functionalities of both the NormalUser and User classes.
